# Recipe Box
Healthier lives through healthier cooking decisions

## Why?
Food is an integral part of our lives. Preparing and sharing food together weaves the social bonds that form families and communities.

But there's more to food than picking something and shoving it into your face. There's the degree of technique and time to prepare, the seasonality of produce and other ingredients, and the nutritional value of the food.

Recipe Box allows you to collect recipes from around the web, then suggests a recipe for a particular meal based upon your available time and energy and nutritional needs.
