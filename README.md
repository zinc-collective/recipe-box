# Recipe Box
Healthier lives through healthier cooking.

## Why?
Food is part of our lives.
Preparing food connects our body to the world around us.
Sharing food weaves social bonds in homes, families and communities.

But sometimes it's hard to figure out what to make.
How much time will it take to prepare?
Is it going to include techniques you're still working on learning?
Do you have the time and energy to do something extravagent, or only simple?
What produce is in season?
How much does the meal cost?
Will the meal support your health and nutrition goals?

When you collect  recipes from around the web into Recipe Box, it suggests a recipe for based upon your available time, energy and nutritional needs.
